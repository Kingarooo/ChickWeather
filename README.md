# Dance Class Scheduler

Welcome to the Dance Class Scheduler! This application helps you manage and schedule dance classes efficiently. It features a React-based frontend with a Scheduler-X calendar for a seamless scheduling experience and a backend built with TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify, and Prisma for robust and scalable data management.
